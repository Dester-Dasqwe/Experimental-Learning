# Experimental-Learning
Just give tips and try out new code and ask for help from others ;D
Yeah just ask others if you need any help. I could really use some help myself!
this wholde github interface is killing me! anyway We will b using github to share code as we Team build a video game
firstoff we need at least 4 members.
2 programmers
1 scene creator
1 character and object designer
this will ensure that everybody gets to help with somehitng. i think unity 3d could be a good software but takes time to learn
the coding is also different but its very easy to set up scenes.
Vs 2013 is sorta...
anyway just enjoy and compare code with others!
we need a better company name also
Enjoy!
# pragma-strict
var health = float: 10.0

function damage();
findobjectwithtag("bullet")

if collision(collide Gamobject = Bullet)
health;--
function die();
if dead (health < 0){
this.destroy
}
just a simple code that will kill the player when his health is less than 0.
it might not all be correct but its a good bit of it. its used by unity 3d and is not pure javescript.
anyways what should our first game be?
need help!
