#python language
hello!
some of us.(mostly me) have been wondering about a programming language called python.
yes python. sounds scary but its just abotu the same as javascript.
simple and fun.
# javascript
Really imple language. just amke a function and tell it what the functin does to a variable (var)
#C# 
father of all prgrmming. first language we ever had.
we dont require you to know it but if you want to 
it could be an interesting topic.
#wings 3d vs. blender
wings3d adn blender are both very useful 33d modeling tools
we will probablhy be using them for most character dsining.(of course somebody comes up with something better)
but which is better?
they both get the job done.
neither of them faster than the other but they will do
what they need to.
i recommend wings3d its a lot easier to use.
blenders interface is just really not going to do it
its just not. when you open it up the firt thing that comes across your
mind is "what on earth are all these buttons for?!!"
#other languages for programming
torque
html
.net
# scene building
Unity 3D is by far the esiest tool for scene building.
very simple click and drag interface as long a you can find what objects you need.
scripting though, can be really wierd.
# github sharing. interfacing is soo complicated. luckily i figured out how to add new files.
you have to just click the + next to expiremental learning or whatever the repositories name is.
you could also make another repositorie. but please dont make like 20 at a time.
ill make a new repositorie for everygame we begin developing.
#We need a blog. and a new company name.
yes its true. our compny name might be a bit shabby. unless you think it sounds fine.
well host a vote.
and we also need a wordpress blog.Connor has one premade. i have 2.
located at:
http://gigsogames.wordpress.com/
http://dondalanecommunity.wordpress.com/
Connors is located at where ever.
# first game
what should our first game be?
we need a good scenario. something 
that would just totally blow our minds away.
Connor suggests we add ingame crafting. like minecraft. 
#hiring more members.
yes we need to hire as many as possile. ask them waht they are good at, then assign them to the team that
fitd them the best.
sorry, but unitl we release a game and it starts selling i dont think anyone would get paid.
#thats it for now!
thats just about about everything!
we probably will have more soon on the subject.
